        <p><span class="scale">HEXACO Personality Inventory</span></p>
        <p>"We began construction of the HEXACO Personality Inventory in the year 2000.
            Our aim was to assess the six personality dimensions found in lexical studies of personality structure as conducted in various languages...
            More recently, we modified the HEXACO-PI to produce the HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised (HEXACO-PI-R)... HEXACO-PI-R assesses four facet-level scales within each of the six factors; in addition to these 24 facets, the interstitial Altruism versus Antagonism variable is a 25th facet scale.
            The HEXACO-PI-R therefore contains 200 items in its full-length version (HEXACO-200), or 100 items in its half-length version (HEXACO-100)."</p><br>
        <p>You can do the test free <a href="https://hexaco.org/">here</a> at the University of Calgary.</p>

    <br>
    <p>"Research suggests that bisexual individuals differ from both same-sex heterosexual and homosexual individuals in a number of ways… Bisexual individuals sometimes differ from both same sex heterosexual and homosexual individuals on personality traits like neuroticism and disagreeable assertiveness (with bisexual individuals higher than other groups), conscientiousness (bisexual individuals lower than other groups…}… reported that moderately bisexual women were higher than more exclusively heterosexual or homosexual women on the “dark triad” of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy…"

    <br>
    <p>”… a number of studies have found that bisexual individuals tend to be higher than heterosexual and homosexual individuals on a number of sexual traits and behaviors not directly related to sexual orientation, with bisexual individuals  reporting higher levels of sex drive, sociosexuality, sexual curiosity and sexual excitement seeking, and larger numbers of lifetime sexual partners than same-sex heterosexual and homosexual individuals, especially among women…"</p>

    <br>
    <p>”The differences just summarized between bisexual individuals and members of other sexual orientation groups… could be characterized as reflecting higher levels of certain kinds of impulses and impulsiveness in bisexual individuals (e.g., higher sexual drive and a tendency toward acting out behaviors), accompanied by lower levels of impulse control (e.g., lower conscientiousness, higher levels of “dark triad” traits).”</p>

    <br>
    <p>Scientific Hypothesis: “One hypothesis that might tie together these diverse findings is that bisexual individuals, on average, experience higher postnatal and adult levels of some sex hormones—particularly androgens—than same-sex heterosexual and homosexual individuals."</p>

    <br>
    <p>"Research has linked variations in adult levels of sex hormones—again, particularly androgens—to traits such as sex drive, sociosexuality, aggressiveness, risk taking, and impulse control, although the evidence for such associations is complex and sometimes inconsistent… These prenatal effects tend to make bisexual individuals less gender typical than same-sex heterosexual individuals but more gender typical than same-sex homosexual individuals (and, presumably, both somewhat “masculinized” and “feminized” in terms of their sexual attractions)."</p>

    <br>
    <p>"In addition, bisexual individuals may, as adults, experience higher levels of circulating levels of testosterone (and perhaps other hormones) than other groups, and this may serve to “energize” sexual interest in both their more-preferred sex and their less preferred sex, and it may also serve to activate a cluster of correlated traits, such as higher sex drive and sociosexuality, some personality traits (such as neuroticism and “dark triad” traits, and reduced conscientiousness), and behavioral tendencies toward impulsivity, sensation seeking, and externalizing behaviors…”</p>
